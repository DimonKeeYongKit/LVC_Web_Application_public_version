# Introduction
This is my final year project for my degree.<br/>
Light Verb Construction(LVC) web application is an online web application that mainly focuses on providing the light verb construction extraction functionality. Light verb construction was one of the subjects of profound discussions in the field of linguistics. In addition, this LVC web application also involves the topic of Natural Language Processing. This LVC web application may automatically collect the posts or content dataset from the Internet and apply it with several algorithms to get the result. Linguists can easily collect and analyze the data set in an automated way. This LVC web application can greatly improve user efficiency and reduce resource expenditures. Not only that, this LVC web application also brings benefits to scholars who are concerned about natural language processing (NLP) research. These scholars can use this LVC web application to refer to and even promote various theories and methods for effective communication between humans and computers in natural language.

##	Objectives
The main reason for proposing this system is to provide a more effective and user-friendly processing method. Besides that, it also eliminates tedious manual work or tasks. There are some main objectives for applying the proposed system.
-	Collect posts on the Internet to enable linguistic analysis and research on light verb construction.
-	Crawl posts from several different social media platforms and archive all crawled posts for future use.
-	Build several different algorithms to help linguists analyze light verb construction.
-	Build a web application to provide services to help linguists conduct research and analysis.
